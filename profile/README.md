  using RPC calls via the **Redis Server**. Also uses Redis for cache.
- **Discord bot** - Accepts commands and posts messages via Discord. Uses **SQLite** for
  storing Discord-related configuration. Communicates with the **API Server** directly or
  using RPC calls via the **Redis Server**. Also uses Redis for cache.
